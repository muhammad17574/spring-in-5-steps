well here we have talk about

dependency injection first thing is we have that is

Basic Things

@component specified that spring need to manage bean of it

@autowired specified that spring need manage object for the given classes

@primary specified that this would be first prority among other beans

@Qaulifire given some name to bean and used under autowired will work first of it

and the last thing is to use autowiring use by name of that bean

***
autowired can be used on setter
without using setter or constructor the default injection is setter
